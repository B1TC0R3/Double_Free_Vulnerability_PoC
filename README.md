# Double Free Proof of Concept.

This file displays how a simple logic error can potentially
give RCE capabilities to an attacker.

In a more realistic scenario, this initial vulnerability would
potentially lead to a buffer overflow, making the exploit more complicated then
it is here.

The file can be compiled with:

```bash
gcc -o poc poc.c
```

The file can then be run with:

```bash
./poc
```

Simply enter a bash command as your username and watch the magic happen.
