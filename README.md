# Double Free Proof of Concept.

This application will force two normal `malloc(...)` calls to point to the same memory address.
In turn, both the pointer `username` and `command` will share the same value.
Due to this, any information entered as the username will then be executed by the `system(...)` function.

This file displays how a simple logic error can potentially
give RCE capabilities to an attacker.

In a more realistic scenario, this initial vulnerability would
potentially lead to a buffer overflow, making the exploit more complicated then
it is here.

Another more likely scenario is a forced crash leading to a DoS vulnerability.

The file can be compiled with:

```bash
gcc -o poc poc.c
```

The file can then be run with:

```bash
./poc
```

Simply enter a bash command as your username and watch the magic happen.
